I'm a data wrangler, data analyst, and visualization geek. I work with Kathleen Weathers (Cary Institute, Millbrook, NY) and Holly Ewing (Bates College, Lewiston, ME). Currently located in Fort Collins, CO on Ute, Cheyenne, Souix, and Arapahoe land.

If I'm not data wrangling, I'm probably riding bikes.
